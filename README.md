IS445 -Data Visualization

Final Project

Biggest Takeaway from this class:

When I studied data visualization in depth, the biggest gain was realizing that data visualization is not just a process of presenting data to an audience, but a tool for communication and communication. By choosing appropriate visualization techniques and design elements, I am able to express the story of the data more clearly, thereby enhancing the audience's understanding and insight. I also learned that I need to be cautious in mining information from data, discovering patterns, and conveying it to others through visual means, because distortion of the expressive effect is real and occurs frequently. Data visualization made me realize that data is more than just cold numbers. There are rich stories and insights behind it, and visualization is an important tool for discovering and sharing these stories.

Things Professor Uhe could improve on as a teacher:

First, incorporating more interactive activities or hands-on projects can deepen students¡¯ understanding of and engagement with the subject matter. I really liked the code inquiry and interactive sessions in the first few classes, but unfortunately there were fewer such sessions after that. The second is to build a platform for students to help each other, so that students can share ideas and learn from each other, which can further enrich the overall learning experience.
